      <h1>THE DRIFTING SOUND</h1>
      <h2> The Haze</h2>
      <p>It was a trip then, til now. How did he get there?  How did he ever make it to the other side.
         He will tell you.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  At least that's what the ole folks say.
         Only the smell of rotting wood coated the usual airy sky.  The town knew. It always does.  With it's drooping 
         eye and quiet sound, it understood clearly.

      <p>Lizzy heard the sound first, it did not frightned her. She immersed herself in the depths of 
         its stillness. Had she been afraid, the mother wouldn't have suffered.

      <h2>Home in the Sun</h2>
      <p>The trip a take is a trip that I take a few times a year.  A place that's warm. The sun feels good on 
         my face.  Some say it is too hot.  I drown in the sun.   The gulf has much to offer. Clearwater, Florida.
         White sandy beaches.  Salty gulf water. Grouper.  AWE! the grouper.  Besides the causeway where bikers, boaters 
         and skier's play.
